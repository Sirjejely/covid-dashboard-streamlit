# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Tracker

An interactive data analytics project to explore, analyze, and visualize COVID-19 trends across selected countries using Jupyter Notebook and Streamlit.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of the Project

- To load and clean global COVID-19 data for accurate analysis.
- To compare total cases and deaths in countries like Nigeria, India, USA, Brazil, and South Africa.
- To calculate and visualize death rates over time.
- To deploy an interactive dashboard using Streamlit for easy exploration.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- **Jupyter Notebook** – for exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **Pandas** – for data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for visualization
- **NumPy** – for numeric operations
- **Streamlit** – for building and deploying the interactive web app
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control and project hosting

## 🧠 Insights and Reflections

- **Global Comparison of COVID-19 Trends**: Developed countries like the USA showed higher case counts, likely due to population size, testing, and reporting infrastructure.
- **Trend Patterns Over Time**: Multiple waves of the pandemic were visible in total case and death trends.
- **Death Rate Variation**: Differences in death rates may reflect healthcare system quality or data accuracy.
- **Importance of Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and date formatting was crucial for accurate analysis.
- **Data Visualization Power**: Charts provided clearer understanding than raw tables.
- **Scalability with Streamlit**: Converting analysis to a `.py` file made it easily deployable and accessible.
